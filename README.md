# Asymptotic-Optimality-in-Data-Driven-Decision-Making
Code for the experiments presented in the paper ``Asymptotic Optimality in Data-Driven Decision Making''

all jupyter notebook files are self-contained

the jupyter notebook vs. Figure/plot correspondence is described via the ``commit message'' which is visible in the depository


the number of jupyter notebooks in this depository is lower than the overall number of plots contained in the 4 figures displayed in this paper for the following reasons
 - Figure 1: no code provided as the creation of respective plots is highly trivial
 - provided jupyter notebooks are written so that they can be easily adapted to generate all remaining plots, for which there is no directly assigned jupiter notebook
